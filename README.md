# Movie-Hybrid-Recommender-System

Welcome to the Movie Hybrid Recommender System implemented in Jupyter Notebook! This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building and using a personalized movie recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. With this system, you can discover new movies that align with your interests and preferences.

# Key Components:
1. Data Exploration and Analysis
2. First Iteration: Building a Hybrid Recommender System with CBF and CF models
3. Feature Engineering
4. Second Iteration: Retraining Content-Based Filtering Model for Enhanced Hybrid Recommender
5. N-Fold Cross Validation Best Model
6. Final Test and Evaluation
7. Conclusion

# Getting Started: 
1. Install Jupyter Notebook: Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine to run this notebook interactively.
2. Clone the Repository: Clone or download this repository to access the Jupyter Notebook and the associated dataset.
3. Dependencies: Review the list of required Python libraries in the requirements.txt file. Install these dependencies using pip to ensure smooth execution.
4. Load the Dataset: Before running the notebook, ensure you have the movie dataset available in the correct format. You may use our sample dataset or replace it with your own.
